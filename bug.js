This bug occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses the Camera component.  The camera preview shows, but when you try to take a picture, the app crashes with no error message in the Expo Go console.  The error only appears on iOS devices, Android functions correctly. The issue seems to be related to asynchronous operations and how the camera permission is handled, specifically when the permission is requested dynamically.
